# 4x4_Matrix_Multiplication
WinMips64 Assembly code for 4x4 Matrix Multiplication, the project was used as a study/exam project, the objective is to show the difference between the C language and the Assembly language for the WinMips64 simulator, focusing on the improvements and differences that one can make by prioritizing one aspect like the size compared to another like the number of total clock cycles of execution, from an "almost machine-level" coding point of view. All starting from a non-optimized version of the code, going through different optimizations and exploring their pros/cons.
